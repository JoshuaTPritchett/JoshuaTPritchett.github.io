## JPrime's Personal Website [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaTPritchett/website.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/JoshuaTPritchett/website)

## Summary

The purpose of this repository is to create my own personal website that allows me to learn and demonstrate the following things:

- [X] Hosting the website on Github Pages
- [ ] [Focus on some testing approaches found here](https://content.pivotal.io/blog/testing-strategies)
    - [ ] Unit Testing
    - [ ] Journeys Testing
    - [ ] Linting
- [ ] Leverage Continuous Integration (CI) practices using Travis CI
    - [ ] Development environment parity
    - [ ] Automated testing
    - [ ] Automated site deployment once master passes testing
- [ ] Learn React.js, Travis and some cool new TDD stuff (which until this site I have never done before)
- [ ] Demonstrate my abilities for recruiters
- [ ] Keep my skills sharp, especially since I am now a Product Manager
    - [ ] Create feature stories using the issues feature in Github

This is just a rough list and I will look to improve this list over time.  Ultimately, I have always wanted to do a mini-site project using entirely open source tools. So I will create detailed goals for this site and myself over time.

## Hosting on Github Pages

I was hoping that hosting a React.js based site on Github pages was going to be an easy task. However, it's proven to be difficult due to how redirects and rendering are performing by Pages. I used the following guides to help me learn and get started:

* [Best example for starting a Github pages React App](https://github.com/firstcontributions/firstcontributions.github.io)
   * `I would highly recommend starting here` as I wasted a solid 4 hours not understanding how redirects work
* [Here is a more detailed guide on how to setup single-page websites](https://github.com/rafrex/spa-github-pages)
